# About us

Southeast Asian Paleo Environments Consortium (SAPEC) is a group of scientists dedicated to the reconstruction of the paleo environment of Southeast Asia, and understanding its variability within the context of the greater global climate system. The SAPEC concept was developed by Brendan Buckley and co-PIs in 2009 at PAGES-NSF sponsored workshop in Da Lat, Vietnam. The realization of bringing multiple regional proxies together for a methods workshop began in earnest in January 2019 with the Isotopes in the Environment Workshop, January 2019 at ICTHER. This 2-day meeting was attended by a small collection of tree ring, speleothem, and lake sediment scientists, as well as historians working in the region. The first official gathering of SAPEC, called SAPEC-2020, will take place from 4-12 January 2019 in Dalat, Vietnam.

# Ideas for a field school

An interview with Brendan Buckley in the early days

1.      What was the catalyst for starting Bidoup Field School?

The idea for the field school was born almost as soon as we began our research at BDNP. We sensed that the security of the amazing natural resources of the park would be compromised without bringing far more public awareness about what was here (hence, what might be lost). The park directorate and myself brainstormed on ways to accomplish a sustainable model for developing the research and education components of what we were already doing and it developed rapidly into the idea of ICTHER (the International Center for Tropical Highlands Ecosystems Research). There is so much that we don’t currently know about these endangered environments and here we had a natural laboratory for study. Bringing in researchers and students to collect and analyze as much data as humanly possible became our driving force.  

2.      How do you measure whether your projects actually make a tangible difference in the communities you serve?

One of our partner organizations from the beginning has been JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency), who have been instrumental in developing infrastructure in the park. They have made a supreme effort to engage the local indigenous populations, and it has been through their dedicated hard work that we are able to see the difference BDNP and ICTHER have made in the community. We have that as one of our central directives – the integration of the local population into everything we do, including the field school. 


3.      Can you explain a bit more of the type of participant you are looking for the travel experience?

We don’t really have a specific type in mind per se, other than those with a desire to learn about tropical ecosystems and who share our desire to gather knowledge and preserve an important part of our natural history. However, we are surely targeting undergraduate and graduate students as a core constituency as they are likely to develop into full time researchers who may wish to follow up with continuing research in the park.  We target students from the region (e.g., ASEAN countries and particularly Singapore and China) but also from Japan, Europe, North American and Australia. Our first field school saw nine countries represented and that led to some amazing friendships being formed. 


4.      Is there an anecdote you can share about a project that resulted from the 1st Bidoup Field School sessions?

It is really too early to say that any new projects have been successfully formed (i.e. funded), but we have gone full steam ahead with the ecophysiological analyses of tree species. We have already learned things about species response to light and temperature that we didn’t know before, and this is directing some new research queries. 


5.      If you had all the power in the world, what would be the one thing you’d change about ecotourism? Why?

Tough question, because I can look at it on several levels. First, the fact that we need to encourage tourism that is anything other than ecologically sensitive saddens me greatly. It is clear that a large portion of the global community that has the necessary resource to travel doesn’t see the greater picture that we are part of an entire ecosystem. By trashing one environment we create downstream consequences that eventually land in our back yard. The problems we face are far too numerous to list, but they surely originate with the overpopulation of our own species, and the absolutely profound impact we have on the world around us. So, if I had all the power in the world I would look for a gentle way of alleviating the population burden on our planet. Since I lack such power I aim to educate as many of our population as I can about the need to respect the great bounty that we have been blessed with on this amazing planet we have been gifted with. 


6.      What is your vision for Bidoup Field School in the next 3-5 years?  What projects and goals are you trying to accomplish?

Initially I just want to see the field school succeed with the modest pilot we are running. By that I mean I hope we can draw enough interest to fill the roster with eager minds that help us collect reams of high quality data for analyses. Then I would like to expand the operation to have two international seasons – dry season (January) and wet season (July), and have double sessions for each. To follow up on each of these it would be great to have copies of these courses conducted entirely in Vietnamese for the local population. Along with the field school we are also developing a trekking trail system that we hope to connect with the neighboring national parks, Chu Yang Sin to the north and Phuoc Binh to the south, opening up opportunities for expanding the field school in both directions. And finally, I am working on bringing a major university to conduct a field course at BDNP. With the facilities we already have in place we can safely and comfortably serve several dozen students, but things can always be improved. That is why we have committed to rolling back a percentage of the proceeds into maintenance and building new and better infrastructure.
