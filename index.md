# About us

Southeast Asian Paleo Environments Consortium (SAPEC) is a group of scientists dedicated to the reconstruction of the paleo environment of Southeast Asia, and understanding its variability within the context of the greater global climate system. The SAPEC concept was developed by Brendan Buckley and co-PIs in 2009 at PAGES-NSF sponsored workshop in Da Lat, Vietnam. The realization of bringing multiple regional proxies together for a methods workshop began in earnest in January 2019 with the Isotopes in the Environment Workshop, January 2019 at ICTHER. This 2-day meeting was attended by a small collection of tree ring, speleothem, and lake sediment scientists, as well as historians working in the region. The first official gathering of SAPEC, called SAPEC-2020, will take place from 4-12 January 2019 in Dalat, Vietnam.
