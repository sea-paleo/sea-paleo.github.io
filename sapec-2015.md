# Description
First inaugural ICTHER Field School at Bidoup Nui Ba National Park, Vietnam
Dendro-Eco-Physiological Applications in Tropical Forest Research

Surprisingly little is known about the spatio-temporal variability of tropical forests, owing primarily to the limitations of the temporal side of things. Dendrochronology can be used for developing accurate dating control through a procedure known as crossdating, where individual rings of long-lived trees are assigned exact calendar dates by accounting for “missing” and “false” rings within each annual growth sequence. The challenges of applying these methods to complex tropical forest trees have proven difficult to overcome. However for Vietnam’s highland forests we have had success with certain conifer species that achieve millennium status, and we have shown the possibility of applying accurate dating to a variety of broadleaf species as well. We are using the resultant annual growth indices from Vietnamese cypress to reconstruct hydroclimate for the region, meaning that accurate measures of regional to synoptic scale climate can be used as an overlay on spatial patterns of species location and age distributions, in order to analyze the effects of hydroclimatic extreme events (severe droughts and pluvials). This becomes particularly germane when more species can be analyzed with accurate dating of growth rings for both canopy dominant and sub-canopy species distributions. In addition to crossdating and measuring growth rings, however, is the need to understand the ecophysiology of tree species’ responses to climate on a variety of time scales. During the course of this inaugural field school we will collect a plethora of data toward this end. Research projects will be developed throughout the course of this week that will be presented on the final day by groups of 4 to 6 participants.
